How the Game was Made: 
I started by first forming the canvas by setting its
width and height for the game area and then creating
the player of a height and width with an animation 
of downward movement of player that is formed using
animation function also adding some constraints on 
downward movement using methods by forming a class 
for creating a Player and using it to define animation
